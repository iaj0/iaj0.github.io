    aboutme: "I was born in Dhaka, Bangladesh on March 18th, 2004. I moved to Singapore at a very young age while my \
     Dad finished his Master's degree at the National University of Singapore. His major was Mechatronics Engineering, and the program back then was one of the first of its kind. \
     That was the first time I was exposed to Mechatronics. Then, when I was around six years old, my family immigrated to Toronto, Canada, where I lived for two years. After that\
     After that, we moved to Fort McMurray, Alberta. After about six years in Alberta, we moved to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where I completed ninth grade. After a year, we would \
     move to Charlottesville, Virginia, which is where I live now. I graduated from Western Albemarle High School summa cum laude and enrolled in the University of Waterloo to pursue\
     Mechatronics Engineering. Mechatronics encompasses mechanical, software, electrical and systems design which makes it a valuable degree in today's tech environment.",
